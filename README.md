# Description
The lefFileParser verifies LEF files.  The parser mechanism exposes the LEF data with callback functionality.

# Limitations
This library is only to parse, at the lowest level, the information contained in the LEF files.  It does not provide an API to store this data in any persistent manner.  This is where the programmer must add their implementation on top of this library to make the data useful.
